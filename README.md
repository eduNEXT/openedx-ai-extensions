# AI Extensibility Framework - Experimental Plugin

This is an experimental plugin for Open edX designed to explore AI extensibility and pipeline generation capabilities. The plugin serves as a proof of concept for integrating artificial intelligence workflows into educational technology systems in a modular and extensible way.

Currently being developed by Felipe Montoya as an initial exploration of AI-powered educational workflows. For more detailed information about the purpose, decisions, and architecture of this project, please refer to the ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) in the repository.

## Status

**Experimental** - This plugin is in active development and should not be used in production environments.
